## Properties of a B+-Tree

1. All leaves are at the bottom level and have a pointer to the next leaf.
2. A B-Tree is defined by the term minimum degree 'BRANCHING_FACTOR'. The value of BRANCHING_FACTOR depends upon disk block size
3. Every node except root must contain at least (ceiling)(L = [BRANCHING_FACTOR - 1]/2) keys.
4. All keys of a node are sorted in increasing order. The child between two keys k1 and k2 contains no keys outside the range from k1 and k2.
5. B-Tree grows and shrinks from the root.
6. Time complexity for Get and Put is O(log n).

## Possible improvements
